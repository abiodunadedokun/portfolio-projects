# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project comprehensively analyses coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022, focusing on identifying key sales trends, understanding customer behavior, and evaluating product performance. The primary objective is to gain actionable insights to improve business strategies, optimize sales, and enhance customer engagement.

#### Tools and Dataset
      Microsoft Excel 2019

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of this analysis include:

##### 1. Total sales over time to uncover seasonal trends and year-over-year growth.
##### 2. Customer segmentation to identify the highest-purchasing customers and explore the impact of loyalty programs.
##### 3. Product performance analysis highlights top-selling coffee types, sizes, and underperforming products.
##### 4. Geographical sales distribution to assess how different countries contribute to overall revenue.

### Coffee Sales Dashboard Insights

This analysis provides valuable insights into coffee sales across several key dimensions such as total sales over time, customer loyalty, product performance, and sales distribution by country.

---

### 1. **Total Sales Over Time (2019-2022)**
   - The dashboard shows a **steady increase in total sales** from 2019 to 2022, with visible seasonal fluctuations.
   June consistently appears as the highest sales month, possibly due to seasonal demand or promotions, while January and February are consistently lower in sales, likely affected by post-holiday slowdowns.
   - Overall, the sales trend is upward, indicating business growth over the years.

### 2. **Product Performance by Coffee Type**
   - Among the coffee types, **Arabica and Robusta** dominate the sales. These types are the most popular and consistently show higher sales volumes.
   - **Liberica and Excelsa** have comparatively lower sales, which may indicate niche or less popular customer preferences. The business could explore targeted marketing or product adjustments for these varieties.

### 3. **Sales by Product Size**
   - The most popular product sizes are **0.5 kg and 1.0 kg**, suggesting that customers prefer medium-sized coffee packages. **Smaller (0.2 kg) and larger (2.5 kg) sizes** have fewer sales, which may reflect customer consumption habits or price sensitivity.

### 4. **Customer Loyalty and Top Customers**
   - **Top 5 customers** (e.g., Don Flintiff, Nealson Cuttler) are highlighted, with sales contributions from these high-value customers. These loyal customers contribute significantly to revenue, which indicates that targeted loyalty programs or rewards could enhance retention.
   - Customers with **loyalty cards** tend to have higher purchasing behavior, reinforcing the importance of loyalty programs in driving repeat business.

### 5. **Sales by Country**
   - **United States and the United Kingdom** lead the sales distribution by country, with Ireland trailing behind. This suggests that most business revenue is concentrated in these two regions. Expansion efforts or localized marketing strategies could help grow sales in less-performing areas like Ireland.

### Business Recommendations:
1. **Increase Promotions in Low-Sales Months**: To boost sales during these slow months, focus on promotional campaigns in January and February.
2. **Promote Loyalty Programs**: Strengthening the loyalty program by offering targeted rewards to top customers can drive higher repeat purchases.
3. **Optimize Product Offering**: Given the popularity of medium-sized packages (0.5 kg and 1.0 kg), focusing more on these sizes while phasing out less popular ones might be beneficial.
4. **Niche Coffee Types**: Targeted marketing for Liberica and Excelsa coffee types could increase popularity. Alternatively, these products could be offered in limited, seasonal promotions.
