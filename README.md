# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project comprehensively analyses coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022, focusing on identifying key sales trends, understanding customer behavior, and evaluating product performance. The primary objective is to gain actionable insights to improve business strategies, optimize sales, and enhance customer engagement.

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of this analysis include:

### Total sales over time to uncover seasonal trends and year-over-year growth.
### Customer segmentation to identify the highest-purchasing customers and explore the impact of loyalty programs.
### Product performance analysis highlights top-selling coffee types and sizes, along with underperforming products.
### Geographical sales distribution to assess how different countries contribute to overall revenue.
